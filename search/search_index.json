I still have no idea why, but power capacitor bursted (replaced one). Polarity is correct, capacity and voltage is the same. Weird, but seems that old japan ones are a bit better in terms of holding correct voltage. Replaced with 50v instead of 25v.</p> <p>Also replaced potentiometers.

I must admit that a sense of love permeates the entire book, especially in its portrayal of animals, their lives, their dependency on people, in the context of zoos. The heartfelt descriptions of moments from the past are truly touching. This is an amazingly deep and complicated book, delivered in a pacifist style.

Worked in bands, created my own, recorded something, etc... I've been a guitar player, but always wanted to try drums. Reason behind this is that i understand how piano works to the edge when i can write ok-ish parts of piano with having actual skill. And i alway felt problem with drums - i never understand how to make really punchy beats. So for sake of this experience, i started learning drums finally! I want to share my path here.</p>"},{"location":"music/drumslearning/#beginning","title":"Beginning","text":"<p>As i know music theory (not extensively, but there is no need to explain what is 3/4 or dotted 8ths), i understtod two things - i need a teacher for correcting basic mistakes (like foot position while kick-drumming or sticks grips) AND at the same time i'm mature enough to find exercises and challenges by myself. So i asked my previous bandmate to help me with learning (he has a long story of teaching drums), paying him his usual money (! please do so, musicians are always... Please just pay for the work)).</p> <p>Melodics - great resource because of it's challenges-oriented idea and gamification.

Especially 1001 Groves or Advanced Funk Studies: add swing, change position of kick drum, try to play triplets or do 3 hats instead of straight 8th notes.
