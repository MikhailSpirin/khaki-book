# [The Dark Khaki Book of Curiosities](https://lyz-code.github.io/blue-book)

This is my personal wiki where I share everything
I know about this world in form of an [online
mkdocs book](https://www.mkdocs.org/) hosted on
[GitHub](https://github.com/MikhailSpirin/khaki-book).

**The wiki is meant to be read [in the web
format](https://lyz-code.github.io/blue-book).**
