### Pre

I really think that with this module i open new story in my euriorack building story. It's 0603 smd, it is XMEGA AVR microcontroller, it is dense and very cool. Here i'll share what was that about.

### Sourcing
Very high-quality PCB and panel were ordered on Pusherman with very little money actually, like <20 USD. Parts are not that available in my country, so it took 2 months more to source all components. I want to highlight switches, which were actually rare for me this time, but i've dound out that i can use other switchjes with slightly diffreent dimensions, just soldered longer legs and gave it proper angles.
Also, XMEGA AVR chip was relatively hard tyo get, Digikey doesn't have them, but locally i've found several sources of (oprobably) leftover modules. Anyway, i guess it is in "hard to find" category and situation will definitely get worse.

### Soldering
Nothing special, just takes a lot of time. AVR sioldering was relatively simple, for all such chips it is important to keep straight postiions in both x and y coordinates - this will guarantee easy removal of solder joints.

### Problems
