# What is here

I love reading. Never bothered remembering what exactly i read, and my middle 30s is best time to start i guess. Reviews and moods are now here:

## Wu Ming-yi - The Stolen Bicycle

'The Stolen Bicycle' is a story set in the Asian region, encompassing Taiwan, Siam, the Japanese Empire, British and Chinese war clashes, all against the backdrop of World War II. Being in a country at war right now, I can't read this book without being deeply moved; it resonates with the current events around me. I must admit that a sense of love permeates the entire book, especially in its portrayal of animals, their lives, their dependency on people, in the context of zoos.
The heartfelt descriptions of moments from the past are truly touching.
This is an amazingly deep and complicated book, delivered in a pacifist style.
In my opinion, anyone who has read more than three books about war in their life will tend towards pacifism.

Score:

Intersting: **8 from 10**
Wood advise it: **5 from 10**
