# What is here

I love reading. Never bothered remembering what exactly i read, and my middle 30s is best time to start i guess. Reviews and moods are now here:

## Wu Ming-yi - The Stolen Bicycle

'The Stolen Bicycle' is a story set in the Asian region, encompassing Taiwan, Siam, the Japanese Empire, British and Chinese war clashes, all against the backdrop of World War II. Being in a country at war right now, I can't read this book without being deeply moved; it resonates with the current events around me. I must admit that a sense of love permeates the entire book, especially in its portrayal of animals, their lives, their dependency on people, in the context of zoos.
The heartfelt descriptions of moments from the past are truly touching.
This is an amazingly deep and complicated book, delivered in a pacifist style.
In my opinion, anyone who has read more than three books about war in their life will tend towards pacifism.

Score:

## Charlie Mackesy - The Boy, the Mole, the Fox and the Horse

So this is a piece of art in my opinion. You open it, you read it, try to understand, maybe cry a bit... Because s.t happens. And then you believe in love again. You belive that actually only love can make you live and find your flow in this story of desperation which some call life.
I can put quotes here but i don't want. I just want you to have this book. I guess this will help
