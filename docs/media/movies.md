## Gigante - 06.10.2023

> Giant (Spanish: Gigante) is a 2009 comedy film, written and directed by Adr√≠an Biniez, an Argentinian film director living in Uruguay.

An unusual, slow-paced, and highly 'ethnic' film. It was truly interesting to explore Montevideo. Essentially, everything that remains is a touching story about a giant metalhead's love (platonically portrayed throughout the entire movie) for a night shift cleaning girl.

The best moment in this movie is when it becomes evident that he finally made a move, and they met on the beach in Montevideo.

Love!
