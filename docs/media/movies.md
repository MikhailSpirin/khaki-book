## Gigante - 06.10.2023

> Giant (Spanish: Gigante) is a 2009 comedy film, written and directed by Adrían Biniez, an Argentinian film director living in Uruguay.

An unusual, slow-paced, and highly 'ethnic' film. It was truly interesting to explore Montevideo. Essentially, everything that remains is a touching story about a giant metalhead's love (platonically portrayed throughout the entire movie) for a night shift cleaning girl.

The best moment in this movie is when it becomes evident that he finally made a move, and they met on the beach in Montevideo.

Love!

Scarlet Johansson, Brian Cox. Amzang log dialogues, like кружева на декорациях

I CANT EXPRESS how i'm ipressed by this film now. It's just incredibely amazing deep and very beautiful movie.
There are films which touch your esthetic part, there are sex-obsessed films, there are complicted dramas. And there are films which touch your heart without all of mentioned earlier layers. "We don't care", says Gallo and Ricci to me. "We want your soul". And they have it, definitely.

"Knocking On The Heavens Door", "Wonderful Truth", "City Of Angels". I think now i have another film where i will be able to tell all the scenes by heart. They all have their own incredibility in every new scene. Sleeping Billy in the street chair with that music at the beginning, dancing Layla in the bowling club, squareformed scene in parents house, where you feel yourself in the eyes of each part of that family. And of course - King Crimson and Yes. Thank you for that!

Especially amazing contrast, because i tried austrian "Antares" movie, which i turned off on 20th minute. I can't watch it, it is ugly. Later found that it has 0 rating on rottentomatoes
What a coincedence...

## Antares - 10.10.2023
I actually turned that off, dfidn't manage to finish first story. May be i will try later, but for now it's ugly and i can't find anything interesting for me in that movie.

Once i said that I hate those local-native-nation-specific movies. Now I say that i find some real love in those. This is a deep example of such case... There are several long stories, beautiful local songs, spiritual experience, poor and rich, beautiful main actress.
Lima backround with its sands and yellows. Alien-looking characters. Fear of the War, even war in the past. Potato flower.
I actually advise this movie to anyone. Just be patient...
