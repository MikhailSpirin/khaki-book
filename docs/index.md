# Welcome!

# What is here
I'm growing my own digital garden here.

Concept is simple: as a human being, i gain knowledge everyday - on my work, in my projects, in my spare time hobbies and such. I'm tired to have it on thousands of text files and paper notes. I will put my knowledge in a form of articles in wiki-style site, which now **contains my human treasure**.

In the event of my unfortunate death, send your deepest condolences and read this site - **my knowledge will not disappear** and i will send my message to those who want to read.
If that's the case - i'm really excited!

My topics are extremely vast, but let's say its mostly about coding, music creation, generative art, electronics, media and such stuff.

# Why not blog?
I do love the idea. I have bunch of different files, notes, todoist account, physical papers; to have blog - you need to select a topic, and how to organise papers?

This option i'm digging much better. Wiki format is great for tree of knowledge, which i'm going to feed.

**Cheers!**
