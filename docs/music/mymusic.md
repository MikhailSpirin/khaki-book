This is my outcome as an "analog guitarist". I was a guitarplayer in a great band Jazzn't Lost, what you see above is our "final statement". And then,

# ...as a Moldymoor

This is my electronic music alias. Mainly IDM, Ambient, Glitch, EDM, written with Elektron tools, bunch of Eurorack modules, Polyend Tracker and other tools.

Projects are:

### The 90 Days of A Bomb Winter

So i decided to track the mood of these 90 days of 2022/2023 winter (of this bomb winter i must add).
Every day i do a modular eurorack track.

Every day i have some words, which are used to AI-generate a cover - via great DeviantArt tool called DreamUp. I add "lyrics" to each of the tracks. Hope you enjoy!
