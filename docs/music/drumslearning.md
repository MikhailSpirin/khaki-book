# Pre-story

I am a musician for a long time. Worked in bands, created my own, recorded something, etc... I've been a guitar player, but always wanted to try drums. Reason behind this is that i understand how piano works to the edge when i can write ok-ish parts of piano with having actual skill. And i alway felt problem with drums - i never understand how to make really punchy beats. So for sake of this experience, i started learning drums finally! I want to share my path here.

# Beginning
As i know music theory (not extensively, but there is no need to explain what is 3/4 or dotted 8ths), i understtod two things - i need a teacher for correcting basic mistakes (like foot position while kick-drumming or sticks grips) AND at the same time i'm mature enough to find exercises and challenges by myself. So i asked my previous bandmate to help me with learning (he has a long story of teaching drums), paying him his usual money (! please do so, musicians are always... Please just pay for the work)).

Melodics - great resource because of it's challenges-oriented idea and gamification. You can spend just enough time to work on one lesson, nothing more - and results are here and very clear.

# Making it better
Double kick-drumming - i found it lot like barre on guitar, spending a lot of time on it without noticeable result, and it's important part for any advanced technics.. Just keep practicing, what can i say. There is no silver bullet in any area which human beings are interested in...

Books. Find books which you like. Mine are shared in next topic.

# Books
I checked lots of books on this topic, and i want to share some of them here:

I like those:

[1001 Drum Grooves: The Complete Resource For Every Drummer](https://www.amazon.ca/1001-Drum-Grooves-Complete-Resource/dp/B00NBJBPXI)

[Advanced Funk Studies](https://www.amazon.com/Advanced-Funk-Studies-Creative-Patterns/dp/B00G3IDRNA)

[Breakbeat Bible](https://www.mikeadamo.com/the-breakbeat-bible)

[The Groove Essentials](https://www.amazon.com/Tommy-Igoe-Groove-Essentials/dp/B00064YTKM)

Please not that you can get more from existing books. Especially 1001 Groves or Advanced Funk Studies:
add swing, change position of kick drum, try to play triplets or do 3 hats instead of straight 8th notes. This makes exercise far more interesting and different and i use this a lot while practicing.
