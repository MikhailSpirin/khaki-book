So I feel like Flow Fields topic deserves separate article, as i'm reading more and more sources about it

Flow Fields (Vector Fields) is very simple - 1d/2d/3d set of values, each describing some vector. If we put particles on such 2d plane and start building traces from those particles, we will see set of beautiful lines

# General Ideas

- Generate 1d vector field for EACH line and sum it with general flow field

- Alternate smth different than direction - color?

- One vector field for direction and one for force
