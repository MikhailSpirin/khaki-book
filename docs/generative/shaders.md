This will describe my experience with shaders.

Main reason why i'm interested in this - i need something to use as background for my music. I love generative art, so to me shaders seem to be pure generative art...

I guess i will come back to shaders from time to time with some inspiration and

# My experience in sessions

Behind this idea, i needed some background video for some new modular track. So i wanted to use shaders, but i didn't have much time to develop something very new; also i had some existing shader which i liked but it was not enough for full video. So i found an article, how to combine to shaders into one (mix with transparency, let's say). This worked perfectly and this is final video:

[stackoverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/61522849/shadertoy-how-to-mix-add-multiply-any-two-shaders)

Outcome is following: You can take CC0 shaders, modify, mix, have some fun in process, then make it your background! Just don't forget to mention sources of inspiration.

Also, i tried several options for recording shadertoy shaders and unfortunately, consumed time didn't paid off. So my main way to do so now will be just capturing the screen with Camtasia...
